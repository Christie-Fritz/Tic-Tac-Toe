# Tic-Tac-Toe
This week we had to create our own Tic-Tac-Toe app and understanding "Parent" and "Child" components inside the app. 
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either (3) O's or (3) X's. Player who has sucessfully have all their characters in a row, column, or diagnoal ("X's" or "O's") wins the game. 

## Improvements to come:
I would like to add more characters to make it more exciting to play, pictures, refresh button, texted lined up with each other, and confetti at the end for the winner.
